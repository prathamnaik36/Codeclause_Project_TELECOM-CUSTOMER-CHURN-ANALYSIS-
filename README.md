# TELECOM-CUSTOMER-CHURN-ANALYSIS

CHURN ANALYSIS :
Churn analysis is the process of using data to understand why your customers have stopped using your product or service. Analyzing your churn doesn’t only mean knowing what your customer churn rate is. It’s about figuring out why customers are churning at the rate they are, and how to fix the problem.

Objectives for this project :


I will explore the data and try to answer some questions like:

•	What's the % of Churn Customers and customers that keep in with the active services?

•	Is there any patterns in Churn Customers based on the gender?

•	Is there any patterns/preference in Churn Customers based on the type of service provided?

•	What's the most profitable service types?

•	Which features and services are most profitable?

•	Many more questions that will arise during the analysis
